# User Evaluation

Everyone in our group choose one person and did a user evaluation in the form of a think aloud evaluation.

## Feedback

This is all feedback from the think aloud evaluation. A checkmark means that we have taken the feedback into account and done something to enhance the user experience with ragards to the feedback. It is also explained what was changed.

### Anna - 15 min

- [ ] Remove "You are not logged in" and put the login/register-buttons there instead. When logged in, the logout-button can be there.
- [ ] When regestering you are not redirected to another page. Would be good to be redirected to another page, could have a popup that states that registering went through, and when it disappears being redierected to some other page.
- [ ] The play-button in the navbar should “stand out” more, it was easy to miss. 
- [ ] Difficult to know what to do when entering play page and not having any playlist to select. Would be nice to let the user know where they can add a new playlist, or maybe have a button that redirects the user to the create-profile page.
- [ ] 10 songs minimum is a bit too much, especially if you want to try the game out easily
- [ ] Would be nice if there were an easy way to test the game without registering a user. 
- [ ] Should probably let the user know if they have not selected a playlist when trying to play the game without a playlist
- [ ] Sometimes the loading of a game takes very long time..
- [ ] It is easy to miss the sidebar tab, we need to make it more clear that it is clickable - perhaps shade the tab or write some text.

### Asta - 20-30 min

- [ ] The words on the Navbar are pale, which makes them hard to read
- [ ] The text on the home page is a bit confusing. Should I click play or register?
- [ ] The register box on the register page is very far down
- [ ] After logging in, maybe you should redirect to home or profile? (currently we are still on register page
- [ ] If you register and then log out the register page is still present with a the page saying you have been registered. kind of confusing.
- [ ] When you log in you redirect to an empty page.
- [ ] He asked how to add friends after having looked at the sidebar. It was empty and just said friends. Maybe add message “You have no friends. Do this to get friends”
- [ ] Creating playlists looks good.
- [ ] 10 songs a bit too much when creating a playlist
- [ ] A number showing how many songs you have added would be nice
- [ ] It is not obvious that you can press the dropdown button on the playlist (he didn’t do it)
- [ ] When on the phone the hamburger menu is not closed when you press a link
- [ ] He asked what the point with the game is when he had started the game. He didn’t understand if you were supposed to answer as fast as possible or just get the right answer
- [ ] He didn’t understand what game speed meant when configuring the game until he had played once.
- [x] When he played the same playlist again he got the same songs and answers. Would be nice if it was different so that you can replay
  - A better random was choosen and used for the game.
- [ ] The game timer broke the game
- [ ] Nice if you could close the game? A button for that maybe?

### Marcus - 15 min

- [ ] It is hard to figure out where to go after you have logged in. Maybe add some text to show that you should login and create a playlist, which you can then play in the quiz. 
- [ ] The sidebar is very hidden and hard to find. 
- [ ] It would be nice to have the ability to see how many questions you have left in the quiz. Now, you don’t really know how much of the quiz you have left when playing. 
- [ ] The text “Which song are you hearing?” should probably be on the top of the game screen not at the bottom, that would make it easier to know what to focus on (hearing) and would also make it look better.
- [ ] The home page looks simple and contains very little information.
- [ ] It would be nice if you could show the profile picture in the profile view.
- [ ] Instead of having a profile button in the navigation menu, you could have the name of the logged in user together with his/her profile picture and make that the profile button. That is how many sites do it, see Instagram, for instance.
- [ ] The register screen takes up too much vertical height, which enables scrolling in the browser. 
- [ ] Nothing happens when we try to start the game without selecting a playlist. Perhaps some notification should show up.

### Filip - 20-30 min

- [ ] The design looks boring. Looks quickly made. 
- [ ] The fields should be emptied when logging in. 
- [ ] Implement an "about" page. 
- [ ] Unclear that you cannot play the game without a playlist. 
- [ ] Rename the playlist to quiz. 
- [ ] Search for song/artist.
- [ ] Should state that there must be 10 songs before starting. Unclear how many songs are required.  
- [ ] Unclear how to get started, first create a list and then click play.
- [ ] Fix so that you cannot enter the game without having a playlist.
- [ ] Maybe increase the time between songs. Alternatively, choose it yourself.
- [ ] More colors in the design. Larger spinner in the middle. 
- [ ] Fix margin in mobile view. Fix so that it says "choose playlist" when you press start and have not made a list. 
- [ ] Margins look bad when we are in the game on a mobile device. The search bar looks bad in mobile view.
